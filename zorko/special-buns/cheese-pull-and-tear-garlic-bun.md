# Cheese Pull & Tear Garlic Bun

## Ingredients:
- Burger Bun – 1 no.

- Pizza Seasoning – 1 pinch
- Mozzarella Cheese – 35-40 g
- Orange Cheese Sauce – 30-35 g

## Method:
1. Cut the burger bun into 6 segments without fully separating them – only make deep half-cuts so the bun stays intact.
2. Apply garlic butter generously inside each slit.
3. Drizzle orange cheese sauce into all the cuts.
4. Fill mozzarella cheese into each segment, ensuring extra cheese in the center.
5. Sprinkle pizza seasoning on top.
6. Microwave for 30 seconds to melt the cheese slightly.
7. Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C until the cheese fully melts and the bun turns slightly crusty.
